## Verify user consent

At Smartlook we use pop up window to ask for user consent. You should implement similar solution on your site.

![User consent](/assets/img/docs/gdpr/consent.png)

Verify if a visitor gave his consent or not by using this code.

```js
<script>
  smartlook(function() {
    console.log(smartlook.consent.api)
    console.log(smartlook.consent.forms)
    console.log(smartlook.consent.ip)
  });
</script>
```

There are 3 possible values that you can see in the console:

1. `true` if user agreed and provided consent
2. `false` if user refused to provide consent
3. `null` if user was not asked for consent yet

## Form inputs

User consented to have his form inputs recorded.

```js
<script>
  // in this variable inser your consent
  var consentText = 'Here goes consent text from your website.';

  // choose only one variable
  var clientDecision = true; // if user agreed and provided consent
  var clientDecision = false; // if user refused to provide consent

  smartlook('consentForms', clientDecision ? consentText : false);
</script>
```

## IP address

User consented to have his IP address recorded.

```js
<script>
  // in this variable inser your consent
  var consentText = 'Here goes consent text from your website.';

  // choose only one variable
  var clientDecision = true; // if user agreed and provided consent
  var clientDecision = false; // if user refused to provide consent

  smartlook('consentIP', clientDecision ? consentText : false);
</script>
```

## Identify user via API

User consented to being identified via the API.

```js
<script>
  // in this variable inser your consent
  var consentText = 'Here goes consent text from your website.';

  // choose only one variable
  var clientDecision = true; // if user agreed and provided consent
  var clientDecision = false; // if user refused to provide consent

  smartlook('consentAPI', clientDecision ? consentText : false);
</script>
```
